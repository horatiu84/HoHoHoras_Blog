(1, 'Santa Claus', 'Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Kris Kringle, or simply Santa, is a legendary figure[1] originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts during the late evening and overnight hours on Christmas Eve. He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves, who make the toys in his North Pole workshop, and with the aid of flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.[2][3]\r\n\r\nThe modern figure of Santa is based on folklore traditions surrounding Saint Nicholas, the English figure of Father Christmas, and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas.\r\n\r\nSanta is generally depicted as a portly, jolly, white-bearded man, often with spectacles, wearing a red coat with white fur collar and cuffs, white-fur-cuffed red trousers, a red hat trimmed with white fur, a black leather belt and boots, carrying a bag full of gifts for children. He is popularly associated with a deep, hearty laugh, frequently rendered in Christmas literature as \"ho, ho, ho!\"', '2023-12-15 14:55:00', 'Santa.jpg'),
(2, 'A romanian Christmas', 'Crăciunul sau Nașterea Domnului (nașterea lui Iisus Hristos) este o sărbătoare creștină celebrată la 25 decembrie (după Stil nou, în calendarul gregorian) sau 7 ianuarie (după Stil vechi, în calendarul iulian) în fiecare an. Ea face parte din cele 12 praznice împărătești ale bisericilor de rit bizantin. În anumite țări, unde creștinii sunt majoritari, Crăciunul e de asemenea sărbătoare legală, iar sărbătoarea se prelungește în ziua următoare, 26 decembrie: a doua zi de Crăciun. De la debutul secolului al XX-lea, Crăciunul devine și o sărbătoare laică, celebrată atât de către creștini, cât și de către cei necreștini, centrul de greutate al celebrării deplasându-se de la participarea în biserică la rit spre aspectul familial al schimbului de cadouri sau, pentru copii, „darurilor de la Moș Crăciun.”', '2023-12-21 10:46:44', 'Craciun.jpg'),
(3, 'Origins of Christmas', 'The precise origin of assigning December 25 as the birth date of Jesus is unclear. The New Testament provides no clues in this regard. December 25 was first identified as the date of Jesus’ birth by Sextus Julius Africanus in 221 and later became the universally accepted date. One widespread explanation of the origin of this date is that December 25 was the Christianizing of the dies solis invicti nati (“day of the birth of the unconquered sun”), a popular holiday in the Roman Empire that celebrated the winter solstice as a symbol of the resurgence of the sun, the casting away of winter and the heralding of the rebirth of spring and summer. Indeed, after December 25 had become widely accepted as the date of Jesus’ birth, Christian writers frequently made the connection between the rebirth of the sun and the birth of the Son. One of the difficulties with this view is that it suggests a nonchalant willingness on the part of the Christian church to appropriate a pagan festival when the early church was so intent on distinguishing itself categorically from pagan beliefs and practices.\r\n\r\nA second view suggests that December 25 became the date of Jesus’ birth by a priori reasoning that identified the spring equinox as the date of the creation of the world and the fourth day of creation, when the light was created, as the day of Jesus’ conception (i.e., March 25). December 25, nine months later, then became the date of Jesus’ birth. For a long time the celebration of Jesus’ birth was observed in conjunction with his baptism, celebrated January 6.', '2023-12-21 20:08:26', 'history-of-christmas.jpg'),
(4, 'What is Christmas?', 'Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.[2][3][4] A feast central to the Christian liturgical year, it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.[5] Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries,[6][7][8] is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians,[9] as well as culturally by many non-Christians,[1][10] and forms an integral part of the holiday season surrounding it.', '2023-12-22 07:28:10', NULL),
(5, 'A brief history of Christmas', 'ORIGINS OF CHRISTMAS\r\nThe origins of Christmas stem from both the pagan and Roman cultures. The Romans actually celebrated two holidays in the month of December. The first was Saturnalia, which was a two-week festival honoring their god of agriculture Saturn. On December 25th, they celebrated the birth of Mithra, their sun god. Both celebrations were raucous, drunken parties.\r\n\r\nAlso in December, in which the darkest day of the year falls, the pagan cultures lit bonfires and candles to keep the darkness at bay. The Romans also incorporated this tradition into their own celebrations.\r\n\r\nAs Christianity spread across Europe, the Christian clergy were not able to curb the pagan customs and celebrations. Since no one knew Jesus’s date of birth, they adapted the pagan ritual into a celebration of His birthday.', '2023-12-22 07:34:11', NULL),
(6, 'The Christmas Hat!', 'Every year, as Christmas rolls around, one will commonly see people wearing red pointed hats. They sometimes have little white balls on top, and they usually have a band of white around the bottom, but they are always red and always pointed. They are often called a Santa Hat in today\'s world, but this hat has been called by many other names throughout history. Remember, in pagan culture, the names and associated meanings often change, but the ritual or tradition remains very much the same. This is the case with the Santa Hat. It has been known throughout history as the Pileus, Phrygian Cap, Cap of Liberty, Freedman\'s Cap, Cap of Mithra, and has only recently taken on the name Santa Hat.', '2023-12-22 10:22:00', NULL),
(8, 'The Christmas Hat', '1. The Santa Hat Is Inspired by the Pileus Hat\r\nThousands of people refer to the red hat as the Santa hat. However, this style was first known as a pileus hat. \r\n\r\nThe pileus hat was popular in Ancient Greece, Pannonia, Eturia, and other nearby regions and looks similar to the modern-day Santa hat. It is a brimless hat that people usually make from felt. \r\n\r\n2. Thomas Nast Drew Santa Claus Wearing a Pileus Hat in 1863\r\nOne of the first modern drawings of Santa Claus dates back to 1863. While there had been many depictions of the fictitious man, this was a unique illustration. Thomas Nast’s visual representation of Santa Claus in 1863 inspired many modern depictions of Claus’s costume.\r\n\r\nNast drawing of Santa\r\n“Merry Old Santa Claus” by US Department of State is marked with CC PDM 1.0\r\n3. Coca-Cola Popularized the Red Santa Hat\r\nMany people believe that the Coca-Cola Company invented Santa Claus. Even though this is not true, it is fair to say that the company played a significant role in the modern costume we see Santa wearing today.\r\n\r\nCoca-cola followed in Thomas Nast’s footsteps, drawing inspiration from his depiction of Santa, who illustrated and consequently popularized the red Santa hat we see today.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The Pope Sometimes Wears a ‘Santa’ Hat\r\nThe pileus became popular in Italy during the Renaissance where they were made from black or red velvet. These hats inspired the Camauro still worn in the Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nWhen Pope Benedict XIV wore one in 2005 people immediately drew a comparison to Santa.\r\n\r\n5. In Parts of Europe Santa Still Wears a Miter Hat\r\nThe Santa we know today originated in Europe as St. Nicholas, a Greek bishop known for his strong defense of Christianity in 300 AD.\r\n\r\nKnown for performing miracles he became the patron saint of children and a ‘magical gift giver.’ In countries like The Netherlands and Austria, the traditional image of St. Nicholas can be seen with the miter hat.', '2023-12-22 14:55:00', 'hat-removebg-preview.png'),
